Sentiment Analysis on Book Reviews
Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on book reviews, classifying them into different sentiment categories (e.g., "Poor", "Average", "Good", "Very Good", "Must Read"). It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning to analyze the reviews and predict sentiment based on the text data.

Features
Sentiment Classification: Classifies book reviews into categories such as "Poor", "Average", "Good", "Very Good", and "Must Read".
Natural Language Processing: Uses NLP techniques like tokenization, sentiment analysis using VADER, and text preprocessing.
Machine Learning: Applies machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) for predicting sentiment from book reviews.
Evaluation: Evaluates models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Ready-to-deploy model using Flask, Streamlit, or other deployment options.
Dataset
The dataset consists of reviews of books including the following fields:

Title: The title of the book.
Review Text: The full text of the review.
Review Summary: A short summary of the review.
Score: Rating from 0 to 5 for the book.
Sentiment Category: The predicted sentiment category based on the review text.
Genre: Genre of the book.
Author: The book's author.
Requirements
To install all dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Key dependencies include:

Python 3.8+
Scikit-learn
NLTK
Pandas
VADER Sentiment
Flask / Streamlit (for deployment)
MLflow (for experiment tracking)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing includes:

Tokenization
Stopword removal
Label encoding for categorical variables
Handling missing values
python
Copy code
from src.preprocess import preprocess_reviews

# Example preprocessing step
clean_data = preprocess_reviews("data/book_reviews.csv")
Model Training
To train the sentiment analysis model, use the train_model.py script:

bash
Copy code
python src/model.py
This script:

Loads the preprocessed data
Trains a machine learning model (Random Forest, SVM)
Saves the trained model to the models/ directory
Model Deployment
To deploy the model using Flask, follow these steps:

Run the Flask app locally:
bash
Copy code
python src/deploy.py
Navigate to your local server:
Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to interact with the deployed model.

MLflow Integration
We use MLflow to track experiments and model performance.

To run MLflow, execute:

bash
Copy code
mlflow run .
Testing
To run unit tests for the project, execute:

bash
Copy code
pytest
Tests are located in the tests/ directory.

Results
The performance of the sentiment analysis models is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best model achieved the following results:

Accuracy: 99%
Precision: 92%
Recall: 92%
F1-score: 92%
